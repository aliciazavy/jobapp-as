## Introduction
The **Job Search App** is a user-friendly tool designed to help users manage and search for job opportunities.

- Add job details (title, company, location, and coordinates).  
- Search for jobs by title or location.  
- Sort jobs alphabetically by location.  
- Visualize job locations on an interactive map.
